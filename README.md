**Active Depression Monitoring and Alert System in Reddit through Machine-Learning**
a social media depression monitoring and alert system using a combination of machine learning and heuristics algorithms. 

## Data14
- **raw data:** data taken from pushshift for confession, depression, suicidewatch subreddit 
- **processed data:** data after manual labeling and split into test and train dataset
- **data for phase 2:** data from the result of our most performant model: bag of words model. This is data input for group_14_d_Monitoring System Code.ipynb

## Code14
- **group_14_0_data_scraping.ipynb**: Code to pull from pushshift.io
- **group_14_0_data_scraping_by_author_for_stage_2.ipynb**: Code to pull data from pushshift.io for phase 2 analysis
- **group_14_0_data_scrapping_preprocess_before_label**: Code to preprocess the data before labeling and split into train and test for phase 1
- **group_14_a_BOW_models.ipynb**: Machine Learning with Bag of Words Method for post classification stage 1
- **group_14_b_CNN-LSTM-Update.ipynb**: Deep Learning Model of CNN + LSTM for post classification stage 1
- **group_14_c_bert.ipynb**: Deep Learning Model with Transfer learning from BERT - ELECTRA for post classification stage 1
