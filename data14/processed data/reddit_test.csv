So in primary school,  our summer holidays were in December and this girl Aliyah had a hard time deciding if she should stay in the country with her mom or go back to Mozambique and spend time with her family that stayed behind. So like the year before, she decided to make the classroom vote and I was the deciding vote because it was a tie. I chose for her to go to Mozambique because it was just a random choice that I picked. So she goes to her homeland and I go home and come back the next year to find out that she had passed due to severe malaria.  

She would never have gotten it if she hadn't left the country because we and thus would possibly still be alive ..  and it haunts me to this day.

Eventually that transitioned to me not wanting to live, but certainly not wanting to die anymore, so I took it as a win - but now I'm starting to slide back into passive ideation and I'm not sure if it's because the medication is working, or because I've been forced to confront my own brain due to being stuck inside alone all day.

A little bit about me:
I'm just your average 25 year old guy, gotta full time job, I have an awesome fiancé and a badass 8 month year old little girl. 

Here's the issue: 
For some time now I've been battling with off and on depression. There are some days that I'm the happiest guy you'll ever meet but other days I truly think that I would be better off dead. The problem is I don't know why I feel that way. I have everything I've ever wanted and I haven't went through anything that traumatic in my life. 

I'm looking for ways that I can try and fight my depression back. I do have insurance but I'm not quite comfortable enough yet financially to be able to pay the copays for a therapist. Most of my money goes to bills and my daughter. 

If there are ways you guys have fought your depression and don't care it will be much appreciated! Again, I hope you all are holding your heads up and are doing well!

At the same time, when I'm asking for simple things and all people give me is life advice that I already know, it just makes me feel like they willingly don't listen to me and are just waiting to hear themselves talk, y'know? I need affection and not just a back-and-forth session of me venting and them just slapping me with a solution when I just need them to listen.

With the quarantine, it's even more difficult because I can't talk in person.

My best friend committed suicide last month. I feel so lost. He shot him self in the head the day before my birthday, his mother sitting in the living room. 

I keep reading all our old texts feeling like I finally pushed him over the edge. All my friends are leaving and keep telling me I’m this selfish person. He always told me how selfish and ignorant I was, but how much he loved me. 

How do I bring comfort to myself with him being gone? 

How would you comfort a loved one for something you wanted to do? 

These are not the words I planned on typing but i just don’t know what to do.  

I think about dying everyday. I am so overwhelmed. 

He attempted so many times but every tome the gun failed. This time, I feel I failed as a friend so see he was going to do it. 

I keep telling myself he didn’t love me or care about me. I cried to him many times about how this would affect me and it’s 10x worse than I thought and he did it anyway.

Suicide grief is something I’ve never experienced. And I’m so sorry.

I started using this site after many videos on YouTube and out different questions people ask and the various communities, but at this point, it just seems as though most people on this site either have terrible social lives or like to make fun of people like “nice guys.” 

Don’t get me wrong. Nice guys are the worse. The problem is that it seems as though people think every socially incompetent person is an incel/ nice guy. I feel as though that’s a dangerous mindset on its own. Grouping these people as though they’re not so different is telling. A terrible ex-boyfriend isn’t an incel, and a narcissist jackass is not always a nice guy.

As for r/AskReddit, these people have no idea how things work. They like to complain about shit.

I do have thoughts about killing myself almost everyday. No one gives a shit about me. Literally no one at all, not even my own family.

I am scared to drive because I think I might crash on purpose. I don't want to kill myself because I know how much it would hurt my family. It would be much easier to die in an accident.

I don't know how to stop dreaming of death. I know something is wrong and I don't know how to fix myself. I am scared for the day my family is no longer a strong enough reason to keep going.
