I was depressed before all of these things started happening, so my depression definitely isn't circumstantial. However I just genuinely feel like I'm stuck in a rut and things keep getting worse and worse and more problems keep popping up and making it so much harder for me to even want to continue. 
I don't have suicidal tendencies but my current situation makes me worry I will if I don't get out of this situation.

I've been seeing a social worker who I've told about my mood swings and eating disorder that I've been struggling with, and expressing my feelings was a real eye-opener for me. I don't have full on depression but I do have depressive periods seemingly at random where thoughts of suicide or self-harm pass through my mind(and on a few occasions, I gave in to urges for the latter). Strangely, there are times where I forget about these feelings and feel positive, only for them to come back full force later. One of the biggest effects this has had is on my appetite. I used to eat like a horse, nowadays however, I can easily go an entire day or two without eating. I have lost 50 pounds from this, going from 260 to 210 in 3 months(keep in mind, I'm 19).

I was told to wait, that she needed time. I still believe in her. I still believe that I still have a chance. However from what I am seeing, it seems that it was just all false hope. It seems every step I take that takes me closer just sends me further back.

All these emotions and regrets are festering in me. Slowly eating me up again

I think me being more aware of it might be a good sign, but that could just be hopeful thinking. I've registered for therapy and am just waiting to do a personality test before things can get underway properly. I just moved to a new place, and I've been having trouble sleeping full nights. I wake up after 4.5 - 6 hours and then I can't get back to sleep. At first I thought it was because of the unfamiliar setting, then the noises coming from the area (I live next door to a baker). I tested going to bed even earlier (21:00 instead of 22:30), but sure enough, I just woke up at 03:00, well before any noise would get underway. Then I thought my bed might (suddenly) be too hard so I padded it with foam. Then I thought I might be getting overheated at night (something I've never had trouble with), but sleeping with fewer covers hasn't helped so far.

I dont know how but somehow all the blame fell on him. Luckily no serious punishment was applied on him and the girl's father was the director of the local hospital and she went there immediatly and no complaints were made.",146,0.0

So, this may pale in comparison with what other people have to confess, but I still had to get it off my chest anyways.

So here's the situation, like many other people my school's been cancelled. One of my exams, a speaking exam, was made online, where they'd only monitor my voice and appearance, and not my computer. As you can guess, I had a document open on my computer and I obviously read from it.

But the thing is, I actually did study for this shit. I spent a good 2 days memorizing parts, anticipating what the examiner would ask, etc. And I really would say that I put effort in, I definitely did not just half-ass the preparation. I could even probably have done the exam without cheating and do well.

But the moment I realized I could cheat, I went for it. I've almost never cheated; throughout my years of school (senior here) I've been a goody-two shoes, I'd almost never played hooky, my grades were good, and I did what was asked of me. And for more context, in the subject that this exam was in, I'm relatively bad at it and so I put a lot more effort into it than my classmates.

I dunno, it seems like an extremely trivial matter to me compared to the other shit going on thanks to Covid 19. But it still bothers me that I did.

I had a hard time accepting possible depression, and explored ED as a hormonal/medical issue with not much success.  Recently tried Wellbutrin XR and upped to 300mg after what I felt were some mild positive results.  And Dr. felt Wellbutrin was best option due to sexual issues.

Have any males who experienced depression-related ED experienced some of this:

Reduced interest in sex (Recently a small uptick mentally, but ED persists)

Reduced urge to achieve penetration/orgasm.  I have been able to get ""fired up"" but it takes quite a bit of work and extra stimulation.

I have had the ability to achieve orgasm, but the hardness doesnt hit until immediately after climax.  Which led me to suspect, in my non professional opinion, that it may have been dopamine related.  So I hope long term wellbutrin helps this.

For the previous six months or so I had been working out really hard, and I was proud of my progress, girls were starting to take notice and it felt good. The gym was always empty, so one day I wanted to try taking some selfies while hitting the weights, in my boxer briefs. Right at that moment, a group of four *popular* juniors (like class president) suddenly approached the door. I quickly run to block it in my underwear as they drew close. 

‚ÄúWhy is this locked?‚Äù

I freeze. They keep trying to open the door. I‚Äôm holding it closed. They don‚Äôt seem to go away. I speak. This was lunacy. 

-‚ÄúOh hey, hey [you], it‚Äôs [me].‚Äù

‚ÄúOpen the door we‚Äôre here to workout.

Was it normal for us to forget something that hurts us? Not for a long term.

What they had done to you, what they had said to you, everything. You couldn't remember anything but you could still feel the pain.

~

The wind beckons lovingly.
 
Urging him towards the edge.
 
A cooling hug for comfort-
 
As he plummets to his end.
 
 
Acting as a cloud,
 
One that's carefree. 
 
The ground doesn't exist,
 
For his eyes aren't open to see.
 
 
As one with the sky,
 
He soars, unrestricted.
 
Too late to realize-
 
What he's just committed.
 
 
A sudden flash of memories.
 
From the past and from the future.
 
Scenes of sorrow and hopefulness.
 
Better seen so much sooner. 
 
 
Your flight turns to a nosedive.
 
Straight down is the only route.
 
The comfort turns to anguish,
 
As you start to have doubts.
 
 
Grabbing at empty space. 
 
Anything to stop the crash.
 
I no longer wish this to be-
 
The moment that is my last. 
 
 
But what's done is done. 
 
No way to turn back now.
 
Before I jumped, i should've just-
 
Checked if I had doubts.
 
 
I really should've thought about-
 
If I had any doubts.
 
I wish I could've known about-
 
Every single doubt.

Sometimes the voices in my head get too loud and they say that I'm not good enough and never will,that I will end up alone and miserable. A few months ago I would do self harm to cope with that. But some time ago I gave a promise to my friend that I wouldn't do that. Been keeping my promise but sometimes it gets too difficult for me to go on. I'm feeling hopeless.

I like the idea that it is not complete. When you write a story, you often think about the beginning, the development and the end. I don't use this form with my characters, there is no end nor devolpment; it is just them going through an exaggerated version of one period of my life.

I like to think that it is my own form of therapy. All of my protagonists take something from me, from my personality or my life. But the process is also possible in the other way : I sometime shift my personality so it can be like one of my character's. 

I wish I could write them down one day. I've been doing this for years.",250,0.0

If you have someone (specifically only 1), it is likely easy to let go, but the more you have, the harder. For me, it is like climbing on a loose rock. If you try climbing halfway up, and stay, you will slip and probably end up farther back (down the mountain), or worse, dead. And if you put all your weight on the rock and climb ALL THE WAY up, it will do 1 of 2 things. 1, allow you to keep climbing, giving you a HUGE boost, or 2, fall and land you up dead. So, if I suddenly lose the person, (the loose rock), I will definitely commit suicide (fall down the mountain), but if I just hang on (to the rock), to my small, meager strand of hope, I just might make it.

Generally though I fully intend to be dead long before she comes around to deciding she wants to be friends again.

This has resulted in another friendship with someone I was incredibly close to pretty much ending because that friend went too far in defending her, and the net result is that I'm pissed at her and don't see her fixing that any time soon. 

I have had multiple people try to tell me this showed me that she cared. If she did, she had plenty of other routes to go that didn't involve panicking my parents or the police.

Probably would be dead if I hadn't stumbled across his music, which ironically, I only found him after he died.

For example:

1. Overpopulation. One less mouth to feed, one less soul that suffers.

2. Capitalistic nightmare. Being a cog in a massive machine which sucks the pleasure out of living. Its a machine which exploits child labor, slavery, totalitarianism and war crimes to uphold our first world standard of life. Every cell phone, every article of clothing, every fruit has been trafficked and likely stolen from less developed nations. 

3. Can't reproduce. Can't add another bloodsucking human to this decrepit world.

4. Reducing the carbon footprint. Suicide is the best thing I can do for the environment. I think of all the trash I produce and the resources I waste on staying alive and cry.

When I was really young I used to visit my grandma whom was living in a foreign country. Due to my lack of understanding of the language and the lack of kids my age to play with since it was a town filled with elderly, I used to spend extended periods of time with animals ranging from hens to farm dogs and so on. For some reason during that time(this was prior to puberty) I used to sometimes get sexually aroused when around animals. Like when I was petting them or if I had a cat sit in my lap. Please note that I‚Äôve never actually attempted to engage in any sort of intercourse with them. The fact that I‚Äôd get aroused around them always made me feel odd. I don‚Äôt get hard around animals anymore. Do you think that was an early stage that could‚Äôve potentially developed into full blown zoophilia?

I'm not doing OK. I need people, and even though I have friends and a fwb now, I can't reach out to those to meet with me. This irrationally makes me feel like I have nobody, because my brain doesn't distinguish between those situations, apparently.

I know that I can keep going for a while, I've seen worse. But my, usually irrational, feeling of ‚Äúthis is how my life is now: alone and useless‚Äù has become a reality, and there is no way to prepp-talk my way out of this. For God knows how long.

I feel as though my lack of sharing means that people shouldn‚Äôt share things with me. The problem is that deep down i just want someone to understand that and help me break out of this cycle.

I‚Äôve also recently been diagnosed with depression and it‚Äôs hard for me to see the importance in trivial day to day communication. Im very closed off so not many people realise that even if i want to keep in contact, i can‚Äôt. I always feel as though there isn‚Äôt a single soul on earth that cares about me.

There maybe few exceptions to this. But for the most part i believe therapy is useless. They get paid to listen to you. They don't even provide solutions. I think it's waste of time and money. It doesn't work. It didn't work. Don't say change your therapist. I did. It is simply pointless.

Think about it they don't care about you. You are nothing. They are just listening to you so that they can get paid. They have bills to pay. I don't blame them.

Why would simply talking to someone about all your personal life is going to change anything?

Its better to simply not talk about anything. Talking doesn't help. Therapist say they won't judge you but it's a lie. Its impossible to not judge a person. It's just how human mind is. They just don't tell you that because thy need that $$$.

727,TooMuchCosmicNoise,2020-03-26 06:36:00,depression,"Sometimes I stumble upon a momentary realization that maybe I'm sick of the endless monologues that I have in my head.. and the endless scenarios that my brain comes up with when I'm facing a certain problem or an obstacle in my life that the only way to shut them down is by listening to a podcast or going to bed hammered, high or tired as fuck. All because there are zero people in my life who are willing to listen and provide feedback or at least share what they think or some solutions.

All of that is nothing compared to the even darker realization that this is how it is going to be for me for most of my life since I've never actually had someone to share anything with. I'm tired of listening to my own brain talking to itself.

Then the startling realization comes to me that if this is how life is meant to be spent then it's not worth living. No matter how attractive the idea of being a loner is, or the idea of solitude is; it's still difficult as hell to adjust to, and this is coming off from someone who spent most of their lives up until their mid 20's alone with their thoughts.",212,0.0

My friend was going through some shit and i didnt want to leave him alone, but everything is fine now. And hes also made a new wonderful friend, far better than i could ever be to him... so he wont be alone. As for my mother, i know she will be sad but she will overcome it quickly. So its ok right? I doubt anyone else would even notice and those who did wouldnt give a shit. Or they would be glad. I wont ever disppoint anyone. Im sorry for everything. I wont bother you again. The piece of shit that everyone hated will be gone forever.

I was standing at the roof of a tall building gazing down. It was a mesmerizing view. I felt the adrenaline rushing through my body but i wasnt afraid. One step would have ended it all. Just one single step...

So its ok right? I can finally escape from this hell. I wont have to live this nightmare everyday anymore. I wont have to go through this shit anymore. I should just do the world a favor and fucking kill myself. It will be better for everyone that way. Everyone will be happy that way.",213,2.0

I also want to die. I've gone through my mother's medicine box and found several drugs that could easily kill me. Luckily, I've stopped myself so far.

I saw a top post that speaks about how the pandemic prohibits therapy. Same thing has happened here. I cant see my regular therapist because of quarantine, so I have to make due at home.

The things I usually enjoy doing I cant go force myself to do because of the pandemic, as well. I'm a fan of shooting pool, but our local bowling alley is closed down. All public tennis courts have been shut down, too. 

I'm not going to say why I feel guilt because I will be eaten alive by downvotes and hate speech. No, I didnt kill anyone. Just know that i hate myself because of what I've done.",173,2.0

I can't necessarily explain the circumstances because it's too long of a story to tell...but i can say this, an aquintance of mine, that I haven't spoken with for 7 or 8 years, that I often credit for helping changing my life for the better. Seeing him be successful in life as well as with his friends and family, Makes me angry (at myself) at the way I treated him, when I was around him. It also frustrates me because he was in contact with my aunt, who also helped me, who unfortunately passed away nearly 3 years ago (to the day).

466,Yozhur,2020-03-30 09:48:00,depression,"What depression is? My interpretation after suffering my whole life. Depression is more of a sympton than a disease. It's a sign that you've exposed yourself to the outer world. Everything you've felt is a limitation in your brain to realize its true potential. It's a block which blocks your creative mind. It limits your minds potential to understand things you've felt during your whole life. What if we go beyond that. Beyond that limit. Imagine that.

These are but a part of my deep thoughts now that my life of depression is getting better and the world is in a bigger crisis than i am. What a great time to unleash your inner mind. Don't you think?",118,0.0
